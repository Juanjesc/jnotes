# What is jNotes?

- It is an application to create notes and save them in `localStorage`, so that when you reload the page, your notes will still appear.

- This application has been made in order to learn and practice React.js .

- You can create or delete as many notes as you want, additionally when you add a new note you can see the exact date it was created.

- Thanks to its search engine you will be able to filter your notes to find them more quickly.
Make sure you type in the search engine in lower case, independently of whether the title of your note has been written in capital letters or not.

- The application is designed to display a maximum of 9 notes on screen, but you can still create more! Thanks to its pagination system, you can have as many note pages as you want.

*Did you see a block of code that helped you with a solution? Did you learn something new today and want a reminder? Write it down and save it in jNotes. You will be able to see the note whenever you want (unless you delete it).*

# What did I need for the creation of this project?

React-paginate --> For the Pagination of the application https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-paginate

React-icons --> For the use of icons. https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/

Nanoid --> To generate unique IDs for each note dynamically, thanks to these ids is that we can access features such as deleting or creating notes for example. https://www.npmjs.com/package/nanoid



Additionally the application has been styled from 0 with only CSS and supported by tools from other creators, such as:

- https://alvarotrigo.com/shadow-gradients/
- https://xsgames.co/animatiss/

# What have I learned from this project?

- How to use React Portals, and how to make use of reusable modal components.

- How to implement npm packages in a React.js project, packages like React-paginate that made pagination logic easier for me. 

- How component props work and how to pass information between components thanks to them.

- How to have a better folder structure, folders as components and styles.

- Being able to create dynamic classes, thanks to hooks like `useState` + ternary operators.

- How to make use of the `useEffect` hook, learn about its second parameter, and when and why we need it. 

- Acquire more knowledge about `JSX`

- Not less important, to be a bit more resolutive, investigate bugs, read documentation, stackoverflow, meet people and get feedback to improve the application.
